# Hello, im ciBorg!

This is my own CI server. I haven't started to add any functionalities yet,
now it only logs the requests made.

# ToDos:
- Weekly backup of logs to S3 and empty the local log.
- Being able to add subscribed repositories
- Run a specific `init.sh` script on push events.
- Do it isolated in a jailed process
